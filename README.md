# ML_Sync-Inertia-Estimation
This set of codes implements our TIA paper "Machine Learning Assisted Inertia Estimation using Ambient Measurements". 


## Introduction:
* The power system has temporal and spatial characteristics, LRCN and GCN based learning algorithms are proposed to estimate system inertia.
* The dataset includes time series profiles of frequency and voltage measurements, the sampling rate of PMU is considered as 200Hz in this work.
* Measuremnts on each generator buses are obtained with graphical information embedded.


## Power system PMU measurements datasets:
* 'train_3rd_wrv.xlsx': measurements of freuqency/RoCoF/voltages magnitude within period 0.0s - 1.0s following the probing signal on each generator bus.
* 'train_3rd_wrv_SNR45db.xlsx': measurements obtained under noisy condition, gaussian distributed noise with SNR at 45dB is added.
* 'train_0.5s_delay.xlsx':freuqency measurements within period 0.5s - 1.5s following the probing signal on each generator bus.
* 'data.dat': nodes and install limits information.

The three excel files are too large to share them on Github. Instead, they are shared on Figshare, along with the raw simulation data. The download link is:
